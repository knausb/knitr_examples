knitr_examples
==============

knitr is a tool which 'knits' together R and pdf, R and Markdown and more.  More information on knitr can be found [here](http://yihui.name/knitr/ "knitr page") as well as [lots of examples](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples "knitr github").  In fact there are so many examples that its sort of daunting, which is why I started my own collection of examples which are more relevant to the work I do.  Oh yeah, information on markdown can be found [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link "Markdown syntax").

Enjoy!
