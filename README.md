knitr_examples
==============

knitr is a tool which 'knits' together R and pdf, R and Markdown and more.  More information on knitr can be found [here](http://yihui.name/knitr/ "knitr page") as well as [lots of examples](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples "knitr github").  In fact there are so many examples that its sort of daunting, which is why I started my own collection of examples which are more relevant to the work I do.  Oh yeah, information on markdown can be found [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link "Markdown syntax").

I typically like to use knitr through [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/ "RStudio") where it is well integrated and has point and click buttons.  Sometimes it may make more sense to interact with knitr at the command line.  A few good commands to remember include:

-knit() - knits input into an output document who's format depends on the input file's extension
-purl() - extract the R code from an input file

More on this can be found in the knitr documentation or the [knitr reference card](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/vignettes/knitr-refcard.pdf "knitr ref card").


Enjoy!
